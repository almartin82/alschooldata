This vignette explores Alabama's public school enrollment data, surfacing key trends and demographic patterns across 10 years of data (2015-2024).

---

## 1. Alabama's enrollment is holding steady

Unlike many states seeing sharp pandemic-driven declines, Alabama's public school enrollment has remained relatively stable around 730,000 students.

```{r statewide-trend}
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2015:2024, use_cache = TRUE)

state_totals <- enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  select(end_year, n_students) |>
  arrange(end_year) |>
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students),
         pct_change = round(change / lag(n_students) * 100, 2))

stopifnot(nrow(state_totals) > 0)
state_totals
```

```{r statewide-chart}
ggplot(state_totals, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = "#9B1B30") +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#9B1B30") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", alpha = 0.7) +
  annotate("text", x = 2020.3, y = max(state_totals$n_students),
           label = "COVID", color = "gray50", hjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, limits = c(700000, 750000)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2015:2024) +
  labs(
    title = "Alabama Public School Enrollment (2015-2024)",
    subtitle = "Statewide enrollment has remained remarkably stable",
    x = "School Year (ending)",
    y = "Total Enrollment"
  )
```

## 2. COVID hit elementary hardest

The pandemic's enrollment impact was felt most sharply in elementary grades, especially kindergarten, which saw significant drops in 2021 as families delayed school entry.

```{r covid-grades}
covid_grades <- enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "06", "09"),
         end_year %in% 2019:2023) |>
  select(end_year, grade_level, n_students) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = end_year, values_from = n_students) |>
  mutate(change_2019_2021 = `2021` - `2019`,
         pct_drop = round(change_2019_2021 / `2019` * 100, 1))

stopifnot(nrow(covid_grades) > 0)
covid_grades
```

```{r covid-chart}
enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "06", "09"),
         end_year %in% 2019:2023) |>
  mutate(grade_level = factor(grade_level,
                              levels = c("K", "01", "06", "09"),
                              labels = c("Kindergarten", "1st Grade", "6th Grade", "9th Grade"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = grade_level)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", alpha = 0.7) +
  annotate("text", x = 2020.1, y = 64000,
           label = "COVID", color = "gray50", hjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "COVID Impact by Grade Level",
    subtitle = "Kindergarten enrollment dropped sharply in 2021",
    x = "School Year",
    y = "Enrollment",
    color = "Grade"
  )
```

## 3. Mobile County is Alabama's largest school system

Mobile County leads all Alabama districts with over 52,000 students, followed by Jefferson County at 35,000.

```{r top-districts}
enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024, use_cache = TRUE) |>
  filter(end_year == 2024)

top_10 <- enr_2024 |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  arrange(desc(n_students)) |>
  head(10) |>
  select(district_name, n_students)

stopifnot(nrow(top_10) > 0)
top_10
```

```{r top-districts-chart}
top_10 |>
  mutate(district_name = forcats::fct_reorder(district_name, n_students)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n_students, y = district_name)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#9B1B30") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Alabama's 10 Largest School Systems (2024)",
    x = "Total Enrollment",
    y = NULL
  )
```

## 4. The suburban surge around Birmingham

While Birmingham City schools shrink, suburban systems like Hoover, Vestavia Hills, and Mountain Brook are growing steadily.

```{r birmingham-suburbs}
bham_area <- enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Hoover|Vestavia|Mountain Brook|Birmingham", district_name)) |>
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = end_year, values_from = n_students)

stopifnot(nrow(bham_area) > 0)
bham_area
```

```{r suburb-chart}
enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Hoover|Vestavia|Mountain Brook|Birmingham City", district_name),
         end_year >= 2018) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = district_name)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", alpha = 0.7) +
  annotate("text", x = 2020.1, y = 23000,
           label = "COVID", color = "gray50", hjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Birmingham Metro Area Enrollment Trends",
    subtitle = "Urban districts decline while suburbs hold steady",
    x = "School Year",
    y = "Enrollment",
    color = "District"
  )
```

## 5. Black Belt schools face accelerating decline

Rural Black Belt counties are losing students at alarming rates, with Greene and Perry counties each down 20% since 2020.

```{r black-belt}
black_belt <- enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Perry|Wilcox|Greene|Sumter", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(district_name) |>
  summarize(
    y2020 = n_students[end_year == 2020],
    y2024 = n_students[end_year == 2024],
    pct_change = round((y2024 / y2020 - 1) * 100, 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(pct_change)

stopifnot(nrow(black_belt) > 0)
black_belt
```

---

## 6. Alabama is 33% Black, 47% white

Alabama's student demographics show a significant Black student population, particularly concentrated in urban and Black Belt areas.

```{r demographics}
demographics <- enr_2024 |>
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian", "multiracial")) |>
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) |>
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct) |>
  arrange(desc(n_students))

stopifnot(nrow(demographics) > 0)
demographics
```

```{r demographics-chart}
demographics |>
  mutate(subgroup = forcats::fct_reorder(subgroup, n_students)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n_students, y = subgroup, fill = subgroup)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(pct, "%")), hjust = -0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma, expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.15))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    title = "Alabama Student Demographics (2024)",
    x = "Number of Students",
    y = NULL
  )
```

---

## 7. Hispanic enrollment is climbing

Hispanic student enrollment has been growing steadily, rising from 4.5% to 7% over the past decade.

```{r hispanic-trend}
hispanic_trend <- enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "hispanic", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 2)) |>
  select(end_year, n_students, pct) |>
  arrange(end_year)

stopifnot(nrow(hispanic_trend) > 0)
hispanic_trend
```

```{r hispanic-chart}

## 8. Huntsville metro is Alabama's growth engine

The Huntsville metro area (Madison City, Madison County, Huntsville City) is the state's fastest-growing region, with all three districts adding students since 2020.

```{r madison-growth}
madison <- enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Madison|Huntsville", district_name)) |>
  group_by(district_name) |>
  summarize(
    y2020 = n_students[end_year == 2020],
    y2024 = n_students[end_year == 2024],
    pct_change = round((y2024 / y2020 - 1) * 100, 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(pct_change))

stopifnot(nrow(madison) > 0)
madison
```

---

## 9. Economically disadvantaged students are the majority

Over 52% of Alabama's public school students qualify as economically disadvantaged, reflecting the state's high poverty rates.

```{r econ-disadv}
econ <- enr_2024 |>
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("econ_disadv", "total_enrollment")) |>
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) |>
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct)

stopifnot(nrow(econ) > 0)
econ
```

---

## 10. Mobile County is larger than many states

Mobile County Public Schools, with over 52,000 students, is one of the largest school systems in the Southeast -- larger than the entire state enrollment of Wyoming.

```{r mobile}
mobile <- enr_2024 |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Mobile", district_name)) |>
  select(district_name, n_students)

stopifnot(nrow(mobile) > 0)
mobile
```

---

## 11. English Learners tripled since 2015

English Learner enrollment has grown from 2% to over 6% of students as Alabama becomes more linguistically diverse.

```{r el-trend}
el_trend <- enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "lep", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 2)) |>
  select(end_year, n_students, pct) |>
  arrange(end_year)

stopifnot(nrow(el_trend) > 0)
el_trend
```

```{r el-chart}

  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = "#4169E1") +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#4169E1") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", alpha = 0.7) +
  annotate("text", x = 2020.3, y = max(el_trend$n_students),
           label = "COVID", color = "gray50", hjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2015:2024) +
  labs(
    title = "English Learner Enrollment in Alabama",
    subtitle = "Dramatic growth as state becomes more linguistically diverse",
    x = "School Year",
    y = "Number of EL Students"
  )
```

## 12. Special education serves 1 in 7 students

Approximately 14% of Alabama students receive special education services, consistently above the national average of 12%.

```{r sped-trend}
sped_trend <- enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "special_ed", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 2)) |>
  select(end_year, n_students, pct) |>
  arrange(end_year)

stopifnot(nrow(sped_trend) > 0)
sped_trend
```

```{r sped-chart}
ggplot(sped_trend, aes(x = end_year, y = pct)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = "#8B4513") +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#8B4513") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 12, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  annotate("text", x = 2016, y = 12.5, label = "National avg (12%)", color = "gray50") +

  annotate("text", x = 2020.3, y = max(sped_trend$pct),
           label = "COVID", color = "gray50", hjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2015:2024) +
  labs(
    title = "Students with Disabilities in Alabama",
    subtitle = "Consistently above the national average",
    x = "School Year",
    y = "Percent of Total Enrollment"
  )
```

## 13. 9th grade is the largest class

The 9th grade "bulge" is a national phenomenon where course failure and retention policies cause grade 9 to have significantly more students than adjacent grades.

```{r grade-distribution}
grade_dist <- enr_2024 |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05",
                            "06", "07", "08", "09", "10", "11", "12")) |>
  mutate(grade_level = factor(grade_level,
                              levels = c("K", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05",
                                        "06", "07", "08", "09", "10", "11", "12"))) |>
  select(grade_level, n_students)

stopifnot(nrow(grade_dist) > 0)
grade_dist
```

```{r grade-chart}
ggplot(grade_dist, aes(x = grade_level, y = n_students)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#9B1B30") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Enrollment by Grade Level (2024)",
    subtitle = "9th grade shows the characteristic 'bulge' from retention",
    x = "Grade Level",
    y = "Number of Students"
  )
```

## 14. Alabama's smallest districts serve under 500 students

Several rural county systems have fewer than 500 students, raising questions about efficiency and sustainability.

```{r smallest-districts}
smallest <- enr_2024 |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  arrange(n_students) |>
  head(10) |>
  select(district_name, n_students)

stopifnot(nrow(smallest) > 0)
smallest
```

```{r smallest-chart}
smallest |>
  mutate(district_name = forcats::fct_reorder(district_name, n_students)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n_students, y = district_name)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#556B2F") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Alabama's 10 Smallest School Systems (2024)",
    subtitle = "Rural counties face consolidation pressure",
    x = "Total Enrollment",
    y = NULL
  )
```

## 15. Elementary enrollment is declining while high school holds steady

While elementary grades (K-5) have seen enrollment declines, high school enrollment has remained more stable, suggesting families are leaving the public system earlier.

```{r grade-band-trends}
grade_bands <- enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05",
                            "09", "10", "11", "12")) |>
  mutate(band = case_when(
    grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05") ~ "Elementary (K-5)",
    grade_level %in% c("09", "10", "11", "12") ~ "High School (9-12)"
  )) |>
  group_by(end_year, band) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students), .groups = "drop") |>
  filter(end_year >= 2019)

stopifnot(nrow(grade_bands) > 0)
grade_bands
```

```{r grade-band-chart}
ggplot(grade_bands, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = band)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", alpha = 0.7) +
  annotate("text", x = 2020.1, y = 340000,
           label = "COVID", color = "gray50", hjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Elementary (K-5)" = "#4169E1", "High School (9-12)" = "#9B1B30")) +
  labs(
    title = "Elementary vs High School Enrollment",
    subtitle = "Elementary showing steeper decline than high school",
    x = "School Year",
    y = "Enrollment",
    color = "Grade Band"
  )
```

## Summary

Alabama's school enrollment data reveals a state in transition:

- **Stable overall enrollment** masks significant regional variation
- **Urban-to-suburban shift** continues around major metros
- **Rural decline** threatens small Black Belt school systems
- **Growing diversity** as Hispanic enrollment steadily increases
- **High poverty rates** with majority economically disadvantaged

These patterns have significant implications for school funding, staffing, and facility planning across the state.
